      <description>This week I wanted to create a sci-fi interior, so I created this corridor with Blender. I felt it lacks of a real subject, and I added this astronaut afterward, looking into space.
I added post render effects, such as glare and lens flare, to give a more &amp;ldquo;cinematic&amp;rdquo; look to the final result.
This is rendered with eevee in Blender 2.8. I&#39;ll be happy to share the project files if asked!</description>

      <description>Second week of creation with Blender. I think January will be around spaceships!
I wanted to showcase the little spaceship I made for the previous art. I animated it and created this hyperdrive effect with particles system and motion blur.

      <description>I&#39;ll try to post 3D art every week here. This is the first creation I made this year with Blender.
The main object with this project was to mess around with volumetrics lighting.
