      <description>This week I wanted to create a sci-fi interior, so I created this corridor with Blender. I felt like the composition lacked of a main subject, so I modeled the astronaut afterwards, looking into space, hlding his helmet.
Everythinh is made with Blender. The corridor is made using hard-surface modeling techniques and the astronaut is sculpted. This is rendered with eevee in Blender 2.8. I&#39;ll be happy to share the project files if asked!</description>

      <description>Second week of creation with Blender. I think January will be around spaceships!
I wanted to showcase the little spaceship I made for the previous art. I animated it and created this hyperdrive effect with particles system and motion blur.
This is rendered with eevee in Blender 2.8. I&#39;ll be happy to share the project files if asked!

      <description>I&#39;ll try to post 3D art every week here. This is the first creation I made this year with Blender.
The main object with this project was to mess around with volumetrics lighting.

      <description>Hi! My name is Lucas Houssa and I&#39;m a curious guy from Belgium.
I&#39;m a physics student at University of Li√®ge, and besides this, I do a lot of things. I&#39;m a webdev and sound engineer and I co-created RETINENS, a collective composed of creators and technicians of the audio-visual domain.
I mainly work with Laravel for the webdev part, and my focus is on the backend.
I&#39;m also a 3D enthusiast that loves to mess around with Blender in my freetime.</description>
